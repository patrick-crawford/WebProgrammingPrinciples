# Practice Exercise

In this in-class exercise we'll create a simple blog post style layout using HTML and CSS. Begin by downloading the [layout.zip](files/layout.zip) file. From there, you will notice that we have both:

- Initial HTML with no CSS: "no-css.html"
- Final version with CSS: "with-css.html"
