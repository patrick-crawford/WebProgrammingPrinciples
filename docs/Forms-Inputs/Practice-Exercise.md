# Practice Exercise

In this in-class exercise we'll create a simple HTML form and then style it using CSS. Begin by downloading the [layout.zip](files/layout.zip) file. From there, you will notice that we have both:

- Initial HTML with no CSS: "form-no-css.html"
- Final version with CSS: "form-styled.html"
