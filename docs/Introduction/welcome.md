# Welcome to Web Programming Principles

The web is the most ubiquitous computing platform in the world. As a developer, learning the web
takes time. There are hundreds of languages, libraries, frameworks, and tools to be learned, some old, some built yesterday, and all being mixed together at once.

The fundamental unit of the web is the [hyperlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink)--the web is interconnected. These weekly
notes provide numerous links to external resources, books, blogs, and sample code. To get
good at the web, you need to be curious and you need to go exploring, you need to try things.

Make sure you follow the links below as you read, and begin to create your own web of knowledge
and experience. No one resource can begin to cover the breadth and depth of web development.

> Question: do I need to read the weekly notes? How about all the many links to external resources?

Yes, you do need to read the weekly notes. You will be tested on this material. We will
discuss it in class, but not cover everything. The external links will help you understand and
master the material. You are advised to read some external material, but you don't need to read
all of it. However, make sure you _do_ read Recommended Readings.
